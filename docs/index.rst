Deltalanguage (The Deltaflow language) is one of a few
self-contained components of |Deltaflow-on-ARTIQ|_ that
allows users to specify compute nodes and
data channels facilitating communications
of the quantum computer's components.
Itâ€™s a hosted domain-specific language based on Python: the nodes are
filled with code corresponding to the hardware that is represented
(currently Python for CPU nodes, Migen for FPGA nodes).

How can I get started?
----------------------

:doc:`install` will guide you through the installation process.
:doc:`tutorials/tutorials` can help you with the first steps in the Deltaflow
world.
:doc:`examples/examples` contain more involved examples for experiences users.
Do not forget about :doc:`coderef` that contains lots of code snippets also
useful to write your first Deltaflow programs.
