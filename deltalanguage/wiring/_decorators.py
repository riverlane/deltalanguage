    """Decorator to turn a function to a block for use in
    :py:class:`DeltaGraph`.

    If called in the context of :py:class:`DeltaGraph` it will
    return a stateless node, which means that the output of such a node is
    fully determined by its inputs; exactly as it happens in functional
    programming.

    The node is evaluated when all compulsory inputs are provided.
    By default each input is compulsory, in order to make it optional use
    :py:class:`Optional<deltalanguage.data_types.Optional>` wrapper.

    .. warning::
        If a node does not have compulsory inputs then it will be evaluated
        continuesly and this can significantly slow down a runtime simulator.
        If node does not have optional inputs consider using
        ``allow_const=True`` to improve performance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    template : NodeTemplate
        Associate this node constructor with this specfied existing node
        template rather than a newly created one.
    name : str
        The name of the node to be made.
    allow_const : bool
        If ``True`` and all inputs are constant then the output of this node is
        calculated only once, cached, and reused at each request.
        This used to reduce the computation load.
    node_key : Optional[str]
        Keyword argument used for providing the node to the block, in case the
        user wants to debug sending & receiving messages in an interactive
        console. Note that this should only be used for debugging; for
        Deltaflow programs in production it should be sufficient to use the
        inputs and return values of a block for communications.
    in_port_size : int
        The maximum size of the node's in ports.
        If 0 then unlimited size.
    latency : Latency
        The estimated latency for running the body.
    lvl : int
        Logging level for the node.


    .. note::
        The function's inputs and outputs have to be typed, otherwise
        the decorator will raise an error.


    Examples
    --------
    The decorated function can be used as a normal python function:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import deltalanguage as dl

        >>> @dl.DeltaBlock()
        ... def foo(a: int) -> int:
        ...     return a + 5

        >>> foo(5)
        10

    The exact same function can be used in the context of
    :py:class:`DeltaGraph`:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> s = dl.lib.StateSaver(object, verbose=True)

        >>> with dl.DeltaGraph() as graph:
        ...     foo_out = foo(5)
        ...     s.save_and_exit(foo_out) # doctest:+ELLIPSIS
        save_and_exit...

        >>> rt = dl.DeltaPySimulator(graph) # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> rt.run() # doctest: +SKIP
        saving 10

    Nodes can also have multiple inputs:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> @dl.DeltaBlock()
        ... def bar(a: int, b: int) -> int:
        ...     return a*b

    Make sure that inputs of such nodes are not mixed up. For this one can
    use keyworded arguments, exactly as in python:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> with dl.DeltaGraph() as graph:
        ...     s.save_and_exit(bar(a=9, b=9)) # doctest:+ELLIPSIS
        save_and_exit...

        >>> rt = dl.DeltaPySimulator(graph) # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> rt.run() # doctest: +SKIP
        saving 81

    For multiple outputs please refer to examples for
    :py:func:`make_forked_return<deltalanguage.data_types.make_forked_return>`.

    Examples
    --------
    The decorated method can be used as a normal python class method:

        >>> class MyClass:
        ...

        >>> my_obj = MyClass(10)
        >>> print(my_obj.bar(5))

    The exact same object can be used in the context of
    :py:class:`DeltaGraph`:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> s = dl.lib.StateSaver(object, verbose=True)

        >>> with dl.DeltaGraph() as graph:
        ...     s.save_and_exit(my_obj.bar(5)) # doctest:+ELLIPSIS
        save_and_exit...

        >>> rt = dl.DeltaPySimulator(graph) # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> rt.run() # doctest: +SKIP
        saving 15

    However if the internal state of the object changes (before or during),
    the result will change:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> my_obj.x = 15

        >>> rt = dl.DeltaPySimulator(graph) # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> rt.run() # doctest: +SKIP
        saving 20

    Nodes can also have multiple inputs exactly as
    :py:class:`DeltaBlock`.

    :py:func:`make_forked_return<deltalanguage.data_types.make_forked_return>`.

    """Decorator to turn a function of a special type (see examples)
    to an interactive node for use in :py:class:`DeltaGraph`.

    The function used with this decorator is not meant to be used on its own
    (i.e. outside of the graph) in contrast with
    :py:class:`DeltaBlock` and :py:class:`DeltaMethodBlock`.

    The types of inputs and outputs have to be defined using ``inputs`` and
    ``outputs``. By default each input is compulsory, in order to make it
    optional use :py:class:`Optional<deltalanguage.data_types.Optional>`
    wrapper.

    Unlike nodes created via :py:class:`DeltaBlock` and
    :py:class:`DeltaMethodBlock`, the interactive node is evaluated only once.
    Thus it's in the user's responsibility to specify when and which
    inputs and outputs are used.
    This is done via ``send`` and ``receive`` methods and shown in examples
    below.

    An interactive node's inputs/outputs can be received/sent simultaneously
    or partially, which gives a lot of flexibility in comparison with
    :py:class:`DeltaBlock` and :py:class:`DeltaMethodBlock`.
    For instance, if a compulsory input is expected then by calling ``receive``
    on this input the node execution will be frozen until the input is
    provided.
    On the other hand, calling ``receive`` for an optional input will not
    freeze the node and simply use ``None`` if no input is provided at
    this instance of time.

    An interactive node should use at least one input or output to communicate
    with other nodes, otherwise runtime simulators, e.g.
    :py:class:`DeltaPySimulator<deltalanguage.runtime.DeltaPySimulator>`,
    might be significantly slowed down by their schedulers.

    Parameters
    ----------
    inputs : List[Tuple[str, Type]]
        The types of the in parameters to the node to be made.
    outputs : Type
        The type of the output for the node to be made.
    name : str
        The name of the node to be made.
    in_port_size : int
        The maximum size of the node's in ports.
        If 0 then unlimited size.
    lvl : int
        Logging level for the node.

    Examples
    --------
    Let's look at the syntax first.
    Here is an example where all inputs are received simultaneously several
    times, before the output is sent off once, then the node becomes idle:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import deltalanguage as dl

        >>> @dl.Interactive(inputs=[("a", int), ("b", int)], outputs=int)
        ... def foo(node: PythonNode):
        ...     internal_memory = 0
        ...
        ...     for i in range(10):
        ...         inputs = node.receive()
        ...         internal_memory += inputs["a"] * inputs["b"]
        ...
        ...     node.send(internal_memory)

    .. note::
        :py:class:`PythonNode` is used to help with syntax highlight.
        For instance when using a linting tool you can access definitions of
        `send` and `receive` methods and see their parameters.

    To use this node in the context of :py:class:`DeltaGraph` a special
    method ``node`` should be used:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> s = dl.lib.StateSaver(int, verbose=True)

        >>> with dl.DeltaGraph() as graph:
        ...     s.save_and_exit(foo.call(a=4, b=5)) # doctest:+ELLIPSIS
        save_and_exit...

        >>> rt = dl.DeltaPySimulator(graph)
        >>> rt.run()
        saving 200

    Here is the case when inputs are read independently:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> @dl.Interactive(inputs=[("a", int), ("b", int)], outputs=int)
        ... def bar(node: PythonNode):
        ...     internal_memory = 0
        ...
        ...     for i in range(10):
        ...         if i%2 == 0:
        ...             internal_memory += node.receive("a")
        ...         else:
        ...             internal_memory -= node.receive("b")
        ...
        ...     node.send(internal_memory)

        >>> with dl.DeltaGraph() as graph:
        ...     s.save_and_exit(bar.call(a=4, b=5)) # doctest:+ELLIPSIS
        save_and_exit...

        >>> rt = dl.DeltaPySimulator(graph)
        >>> rt.run()
        saving -5

    In case of multiple outputs make sure to call
    :py:func:`make_forked_return<deltalanguage.data_types.make_forked_return>`
    beforehand, then the outputs can be send out in any configuration:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import deltalanguage as dl

        >>> TwoIntsT, TwoIntsC = dl.make_forked_return({'x': int, 'y': int})

        >>> @dl.Interactive(inputs=[("a", int)], outputs=TwoIntsT)
        ... def baz(node: PythonNode):
        ...     for i in range(10):
        ...         a = node.receive("a")
        ...         if a%3 == 0:
        ...             node.send(TwoIntsC(x=a, y=None))
        ...         elif a%3 == 1:
        ...             node.send(TwoIntsC(x=None, y=a))
        ...         else:
