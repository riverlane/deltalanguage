    ..

        It's basically :py:class:`PyMethodBody`, but...
        the node is evaluated multiple times until we have an output.

        The reason for this is the following:

        - if a migen node has multiple outputs, they will be forked using
        ``make_forked_return``
        - the result of the node is ready only after several cycles
        - in the meantime the result should be set to _some_ value, like
          ``None`` or ``ForkedReturn(None, None, ...)``
        - I chose to set the entire output to None until the node produces
        a result

        This policy should be revised when we start working on protocol
        adaptors.

        :py:meth:`MigenNodeTemplate.tb_generator` has the number of iterations
        defined, that number should be chosen such that it's enough to produce
        an output. Otherwise this body will loop forever.
