    Deltalangauage allows the programmer to define a graph of all the compute
    elements and declare the transport of data between them. Depending on which
    type of hardware a part of the program is running on, the nodes of this
    graph get filled with python (for the CPU) or migen (for the FPGAs).
    A hardware abstraction layer is built into the language, that standardises
    which operations can be triggered on qubits.
    This makes Deltaflow portable across technologies.
