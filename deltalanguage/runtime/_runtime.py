class DeltaPySimulator:
    """Python runtime simulator for running
    :py:class:`DeltaGraph<deltalanguage.wiring.DeltaGraph>`.

    The main purpose of this simulator is debugging of the graph and basic
    testing. Please note that this implementation is not
    optimized for high performance, thus do not try to run big graphs in it,
    instead use Deltasimulator package.

    The advantage of this implementation is that you can debug nodes in
    Python ecosystem without need to verilate Migen code and compile any
    SystemC libraries.

    At initialization it spins out an individual ``threading.Thread``
    for each node's body. Inputs and outputs to which are managed by
    corresponding input and output ports. The transfer of data is facilitated
    by channels implemented as :py:class:`DeltaQueue`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph : DeltaGraph
        The graph which will be executed.
    lvl : int
        The level at which logs are displayed.
        These are the same levels as in Python's ``logging`` module.
        By default only error logs are displayed.
    msg_lvl : int
        The level at which logs from messages between nodes are displayed.
        These are the same levels as in Python's ``logging`` module.
        By default only error logs are displayed.
    switchinterval : float
        Passed to `sys.setswitchinterval`, which
        sets the interpreterâ€™s thread switch interval (in seconds).
        This argument is provided for speed optimization of this simulator
        implementation.
    queue_size : int
        This is a global parameter for all instances of :py:class:`DeltaQueue`
        created by the simulator.
        The default value 16 is chosen in analogy with ``sc_fifo`` in SystemC,
        this means that the Python GIL will be forced to run another node's
        thread once the queue is full, thus it will prevent blockage.
    queue_interval : float
        When the simulation is called to stop, some of the queues might be
        blocking nodes at ``put`` methods as they are full. The simulator
        interrupts this at this periodicity (in seconds) and checks if
        stopping is needed.


    .. note::
        In order to reduce computation the results of constant nodes are
        evaluated only once, cached, and streamed outwards continiously.


    Examples
    --------
    After a graph is defined it is handed to this simulator:

    .. code-block:: python

        >>> import deltalanguage as dl

         # helper node that saves the result
        >>> s = dl.lib.StateSaver(int, verbose=True)

        >>> with dl.DeltaGraph() as graph:
        ...     s.save_and_exit(5)

        >>> rt = dl.DeltaPySimulator(graph)
        >>> rt.run()
        saving 5

    Please refer to the tutorial :file:`logging_and_debugging.ipynb`
    for interactive use cases.
