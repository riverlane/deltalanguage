"""Collection of graphs, which we use to track performance of
runtimes and runtime simulators.

Note that performance benchmarks depend on hardware, thus if any of processing
units is updated the performance might benchmarks should too.

Proposed topics:

- time as metrics (test_blocking.py)
  - speed tests with a lot of messages
  - how queue blocking work

- number of messages as metrics
  - we don't have them so far
