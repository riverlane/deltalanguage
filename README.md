# Deltalanguage

[![Build Status](http://jenkins-riverlane.northeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/buildStatus/icon?job=deltalanguage_multibranch_build%2Fdev)](http://jenkins-riverlane.northeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/job/deltalanguage_multibranch_build/job/dev/)

Deltalanguage allows the programmer to define a graph of all the compute
elements and declare the transport of data between them.
Depending on which type of hardware a part of the program is running on,
the nodes of this graph get filled with Python (for the CPU) or Migen
(for the FPGAs).
A hardware abstraction layer is built into the language, that standardises
which operations can be triggered on qubits. 
This makes Deltaflow portable across technologies.

Deltalanguage is used by the Deltaflow-on-ARTIQ system, documentation
for this system and all it's components can be found 
[here](https://riverlane.github.io/deltaflow-on-artiq).
